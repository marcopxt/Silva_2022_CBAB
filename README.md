Table S1. Selection coincidence analysis of the selected individuals in decreasing order of estimated GEBVs by each selection index and the individuals selected by the highest true genetic values, for the simulated traits C1, C2, C3, and C4.

Table S2. Coincidence of the selected individuals in decreasing order of GEBVs for traits C1, C3 and C4 and in ascending order for trait C2, estimated by each selection index and the individuals selected, following the same criteria, by true genetic values.
